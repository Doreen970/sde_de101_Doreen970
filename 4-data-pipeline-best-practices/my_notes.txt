The following are practices to implement when creating our data pipelines:

1. Use standard patterns to transform your data ie we have raw layer, transformed layer, consumption layer and interface layer.

2. We should ensure data is valid before exposing to consumers ie we should check that the data meets our expectations and it passes the checks.

3. Avoid data duplicates
We should ensure that when we rerun our data pipelines, we do not get duplicate rows.

4. Write DRY code and ensure I/O is separate from transformation
If there is a module or function that does one thing repetitively, this module or function should only be written in one place. 
The functions or code for data input and output operations should be different from the code used to perform data transformation.

5. Understand how data flows through your pipelines and what is happening at each stage

6. When you write tests to check your code, ensure they do not break your system. Ensure the checks do not change or distort the functioning of your system.
